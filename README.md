This is simple example of how to get config capabilities within your tests, take a look at https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/4719. 

Dependencies
------------

Here I used [protractor-firefox-support](https://github.com/IgorSasovets/protractor-firefox-support) lib that provides custom implementations of basic Action class functions for e2e tests in Firefox using Protractor. 
Take a look at https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/4687 for issue description.
